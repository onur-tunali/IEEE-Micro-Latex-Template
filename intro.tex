\section{Text Styles}

All content (including tables, figures, figure captions, reference numbers, and algorithms) must have a style applied. Please access the styles by clicking on Microsoft Word’s “Home” menu, and selecting from the “Styles” submenu. In the list of Styles, paragraph style names are in all
capital letters (for example, “PARAGRAPH”). Character style names are lowercase (for example, “reference number”)
