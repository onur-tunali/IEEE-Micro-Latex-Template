\section*{Conclusion}

In this paper, we study logic synthesis and defect tolerance of memristor based crossbar arrays. We propose two-level and multi-level logic synthesis techniques. In addition, we devise a defect model and propose a hybrid defect tolerant logic mapping method. We show that in spite of defective components, securing a valid mapping is achievable with an appropriate algorithm. As a future direction, we plan to integrate multi-level logic design with our defect tolerant logic mapping meth-ods.
